# Twenty Four Game

## Overview

Welcome to the **Twenty Four Game**! This program challenges you to use four numbers and basic mathematical operations to achieve a total of 24. You can choose from an easy mode with preset numbers or a hard mode with a larger set of possibilities. This was my first project in C for the course CS 211 (UIC)

## Features

- **Easy Mode**: Work with a fixed set of numbers.
- **Hard Mode**: Use a larger set of numbers with various combinations.
- **Debug Mode**: Display all combinations of numbers and operations that result in 24.
- Interactive command-line interface for user inputs and feedback.

## Requirements

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A terminal or command line interface
- Basic knowledge of C programming

## How to Run
1. To run in **debug mode**, run:
```bash
./twenty_four_game -d 1
```

2. To play in **easy mode**, run:
```bash
./twenty_four_game -e 1
```

2. To play in **hard mode**, run:
```bash
./twenty_four_game -e 0
```

Default flags are:
```bash
./twenty_four_game -d 0 -e 1
```

### Have fun playing!
